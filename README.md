# State of Wasm

This repository is intended as a mapping and exploration of the promises / areas of application of WebAssembly as of today. It is to be used in a Workshop setting in which the host first outlines the Story of Wasm with a subsequent dive into an actual hands-on application of the various areas of application to see how the promises feel / hold up in real code.

You can find Challenges to work on in the Workshop setting in all folders in a file called `CHALLENGE.md`
