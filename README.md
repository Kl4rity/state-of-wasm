## Overview

This repository contains code to explore the workings of WASMCloud. It is a basic setup built on top of a local WASMCloud installation that you can get via Homebrew.

```sh
brew install wasmcloud
```

Both the /rust and the /hello folders have been created by following the WASMCloud [Quickstart](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/tour/hello-world).
