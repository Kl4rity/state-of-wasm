# The C/C++/Rust Ecosystem on the Web

Exisitng software has been ported to the Web with Emscripten as well as the Rust Ecosystem. These projects have mostly been wrapped in JS-Friendly adapter layers which make them easy to use. It is not productive to re-implement what
exists out there already, so I've listed a few items of interest here:

* [SQLite](https://www.sql-practice.com/)
* [Audio Processing](https://mediaedits.io/)
* [Redis](https://narma.github.io/2015/redis-in-browser/)
* [Video Encodings and Conversion](https://fileconverter.digital/)

... feel free to take a look at the recommendations made by [webassembly.org](https://webassembly.org/docs/use-cases/).
